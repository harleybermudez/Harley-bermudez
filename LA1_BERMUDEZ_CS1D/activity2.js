// made variable for 2 numbers and sored 2 numbers.
firstFavNum = 34;
secondFavNum = 35;
// so i made a variable for each operation so i can call them to print.
addition =(firstFavNum + secondFavNum);
subtraction =(firstFavNum - secondFavNum);
multiplication =(firstFavNum * secondFavNum);
divition = (firstFavNum / secondFavNum);
Modulu = (firstFavNum % secondFavNum);
Exponentiation = (firstFavNum ** secondFavNum);
console.log("Addition = ", addition,",Subtraction = ", subtraction,",Multiplication = ", multiplication,",Division = ", divition,",Modulus = ", Modulu,",Exponentiation = ", Exponentiation)
// i called the variables and added some string so that it wont be just numbers, and added comma to seperate each operations.
